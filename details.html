					<p>Haruka was a kind girl, always helping out her neighbors. One night, she had the misfortune of being a victim of a supernatural attack, which left her as the sole survival and transformed her into something she couldn't come to terms with. Determined not to let this control her life, she tried to carry on normally. One day, during her middle school english lesson, a thud sounded through her classroom. Haruka had passed out, and was asleep with her head on her desk, pencil still in hand. The nurses were clueless, and, after being rushed to the emergency room, the doctors gave similar reports. Six months later, Haruka awoke to a hospital room full of her classmates who had came to see her. Feeling quite braver, and knowing that she needed a better solution than extended resting time, Haruka consulted privately with the doctors about her condition. There seemed to be only two ways out, and neither were perfect. Thus, Haruka's quirk went from a strengthener, to what she has dubbed 'Inhuman'. It propels her to be better than a human in every way, from simple speed to quicker regeneration. However, this all uses up Haruka's energy. There are two ways for Haruka to regain her energy, and she has picked the lesser of two evils. In order to restore her energy, Haruka sleeps more than a regular human does. Depending on how much energy was expended will determine how long she has to rest. Because of these developments, she has received a bit of extra training outside of school, etc. and was able to get into U.A. by recommendation. She isn't just a strong-willed girl, she is a girl determined to be the best she can be. Though... There are rumours about why her dorm door is always chained shut at night... And some say that you can hear faint growls coming from her room.. This has given her the nickname '悪魔' by those who aren't very kind to her.</p>
