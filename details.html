						<br>General Information:♡

					<br>✒For the most part I tend to match detail and literacy, though I will try to make it known when I can't keep up.
				  <br>✒I am a proud 25 year old, so beware kiddens.
				  <br>✒I have seen all current episodes of Kimetsu no Yaiba at least once, so I'm not in the dark when it comes to Nezuko.
				  <br>♡I will typically try to keep my Nezuko more canon, but sometimes I'll put a bit of a personal interpretation on input.
				  <br>♡Dark themes are a definite: Blood, Gore, Death, etc
				  <br>❀Nezuko is at the ripe age of 18! It's not because I want lewd, it's because more mature ages match dark themes more.
				  <br>❀Since my Nezuko follows the anime, she is very tame towards humans and sees them as her family. She refuses to attack a human, no matter how tempting it is.
				  <br>❀Also, because I follow the anime, my Nezuko has developed her Blood Demon Art, Exploding Blood, however she still needs to work on it more and let her abilities blossom.
				  <br>✒I am a lesbian. Please don't try to ask me out or make me change my sexuality for you, because I won't. I'll probably softblock you. Continued harrassment will result in a permanent block.
				  <br>♡Please don't comment on pinned!</p>
